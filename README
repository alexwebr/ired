RED stands for the raw editor
=============================

red aims to be a minimalistic reimplementation of the radare shell
without much complexity and relaying all the extensibility to
external applications trying to keep the source as small as possible.

COMMANDS
========

? is for help
x hexdump
X dword dump   (32bit hex values?)
o octdump
> file          dump current block to file
< file          slurp file into current block
w "string\x00"  write string
w 023839400     write hexpairs
b 30            set block size
s addr          seek address
o open          allow to open file number # or named
                no arguments show all files in argv

print command
 b/w/d/q   byte, word, dword, qword (little endian)
 B/W/D/Q   byte, word, dword, qword (big endian)
 i/I/f/F   int32 (lil, big), float (lil, big)
 z/Z       zero-terminatted strings
 s/S       pointer to string
 ./:       skip 1 or 4 chars
 *         repeat last value until death

TODO/TOTHINK
============
Remove '.' command? do it suckless
filesize support
endian support
dump in hex like in gdb's x/x

flags (implement basic 'f' command to flag) usable from seek
  - better to use flags defined on a file, and use grep and
    so on to retrieve them?
