RED stands for the raw editor
=============================

red aims to be a minimalistic reimplementation of the radare shell
without much complexity and relaying all the extensibility to
external applications trying to keep the source as small as possible.

? is for help
x hexdump
X dword dump   (32bit hex values?)
o octdump
w "string\x00"  write string
w 023839400     write hexpairs
b 30            set block size
s addr          seek address
o open          allow to open file number # or named
                no arguments show all files in argv
peek/poke from files? using the '<' and '>' commands

TODO
====
filesize support
go next/previous/file  - o #
endian support
dump in hex like in gdb's x/x

flags (implement basic 'f' command to flag) usable from seek
  - better to use flags defined on a file, and use grep and
    so on to retrieve them?
